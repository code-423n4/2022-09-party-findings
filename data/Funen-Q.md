1. Missing revert for mint()

https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/CrowdfundNFT.sol#L141-L148

Since [`burn`](https://github.com/PartyDAO/party-contracts-c4/blob/3896577b8f0fa16cba129dc2867aba786b730c1b/contracts/crowdfund/CrowdfundNFT.sol#L157) was using an revert and notify if AlreadyBurned. So this can be impl on mint() if there was AlreadyMint

2. Missing Event 

This below can be set for event since these function can notify if listing was clean.

5. Missmatch comment with the code

instead `isIncluded` changed to `includedWordValues`, since it was wrote in the coded below :

6.  Locked Pragma Compiler

Since it was used ^0.8.0. As the compiler can be use for example 0.8.14 and consider locking at this version the same as another. It can be consider using  locking the pragma version whenever possible and avoid using a floating pragma in the final deployment. Since it can be problematic, if there are publicly disclosed bugs and issues that affect the current compiler version used.
