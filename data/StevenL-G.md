First Gas optimization - Using unchecked blocks can save gas.

Solidity version 0.8+ comes with implicit overflow and underflow checks on unsigned integers. When an overflow or an underflow isnâ€™t possible (as an example, when a comparison is made before the arithmetic operation), some gas can be saved by using an unchecked block

Second Gas optimization - Multiple mapping of addres can be combined into a single mapping of an struct.
