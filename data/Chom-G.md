## Using unchecked { ++i } for loops

Crowdfund _getFinalContribution

```
        uint256 numContributions = contributions.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numContributions; ++i) {
            ethContributed += contributions[i].amount;
        }
```

And other places that follow this pattern should be rewrite into

```
        uint256 numContributions = contributions.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < numContributions;) {
            ethContributed += contributions[i].amount;
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
```

## Add unchecked

if condition has already prevented overflow / underflow

                if (c.previousTotalContributions >= totalEthUsed) {
                    // This entire contribution was not used.
                    ethOwed += c.amount;
                } else if (c.previousTotalContributions + c.amount <= totalEthUsed) {
                    // This entire contribution was used.
                    ethUsed += c.amount;
                } else {
                    // This contribution was partially used.
                    uint256 partialEthUsed = totalEthUsed - c.previousTotalContributions;
                    ethUsed += partialEthUsed;
                    ethOwed = c.amount - partialEthUsed;
                }
